## Key Components

### 1. Hardware Abstraction

**GPIO Handling:**
- Real hardware: Uses `RPi.GPIO` when available
- Simulation: Falls back to `DummyGPIO` class
- Automatic detection and graceful fallback

**Why this matters:**
- Enables development/testing without Raspberry Pi
- Same code runs on development machines and Pi
- No conditional logic in main program flow

### 2. Motor Control (`MotorController`)

**Half-Step Sequence:**
```python
STEP_SEQUENCE = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1],  # Step 0
    [1, 0, 0, 0],  # Step 1
    [1, 1, 0, 0],  # Step 2
    [0, 1, 0, 0],  # Step 3
    [0, 1, 1, 0],  # Step 4
    [0, 0, 1, 0],  # Step 5
    [0, 0, 1, 1],  # Step 6
    [0, 0, 0, 1],  # Step 7
]
```

**Motor Direction Handling:**
- Left motor: Steps forward through sequence (index++)
- Right motor: Steps backward through sequence (index--) due to opposite mounting
- This ensures both wheels move robot forward when commanded

**Step Resolution:**
- 4096 steps per full wheel revolution
- Wheel circumference: 2πr = 0.319 meters
- Steps per meter: ~12,830 steps/meter
- Resolution: ~0.078 mm per step (sub-millimeter accuracy)

### 3. Differential Drive Kinematics

**Core Equations:**

For a motion with linear distance `d` and rotation `Δθ`:

```
distance_left = d - (b/2) × Δθ
distance_right = d + (b/2) × Δθ
```

Where `b = 0.02225 m` (track width)

**Derivation:**

The robot's center moves distance `d` while rotating by `Δθ`. The rotation happens about the instantaneous center of curvature (ICC).

For the left wheel:
- Radius to ICC: `R - b/2` (inner wheel)
- Arc length: `(R - b/2) × Δθ`

For the right wheel:
- Radius to ICC: `R + b/2` (outer wheel)
- Arc length: `(R + b/2) × Δθ`

The robot center moves: `d = R × Δθ`

Therefore: `R = d / Δθ`

Substituting:
- `distance_left = (d/Δθ - b/2) × Δθ = d - (b/2)Δθ` ✓
- `distance_right = (d/Δθ + b/2) × Δθ = d + (b/2)Δθ` ✓

**Special Cases:**

1. **Straight line** (Δθ = 0):
   - `distance_left = distance_right = d`
   - Both wheels travel equally

2. **Pure rotation** (d ≈ 0):
   - `distance_left = -(b/2)Δθ`
   - `distance_right = +(b/2)Δθ`
   - Wheels move opposite directions (spin in place)

3. **Gentle curve** (small Δθ):
   - Outer wheel travels slightly more
   - Inner wheel travels slightly less
   - Difference proportional to rotation

### 4. Bresenham Stepping Algorithm

**Purpose:** Synchronize both motors so they finish at the same time

**Algorithm:**
```python
def execute_synchronized_motion(left_steps, right_steps):
    # Determine major axis (motor with more steps)
    major_count = max(abs(left_steps), abs(right_steps))
    minor_count = min(abs(left_steps), abs(right_steps))

    error = 0
    for i in range(major_count):
        # Always step major motor
        step_motor(major_motor)

        # Accumulate error
        error += minor_count

        # Step minor motor when threshold exceeded
        if error >= major_count:
            step_motor(minor_motor)
            error -= major_count

        delay()
```

**Example:**

Left needs 100 steps, right needs 120 steps:
- Major = right (120), minor = left (100)
- Ratio = 100/120 = 5/6
- Right steps every iteration (120 times)
- Left steps ~5 out of every 6 iterations (100 times)
- Both finish simultaneously

**Why Bresenham?**
- Integer-only arithmetic (fast, no floating point)
- Minimizes error accumulation
- Guarantees both motors finish together
- Maintains correct path curvature throughout motion

### 5. Path Sampling and Execution

**Parametric Curve Sampling:**

Backend provides curves as mathematical expressions:
```json
{
  "x_rel": "cos(t) * radius",
  "y_rel": "sin(t) * radius",
  "t_min": 0.0,
  "t_max": 6.283185307179586
}
```

Script samples at regular intervals:
- Drawing segments: 100 samples (higher accuracy)
- Travel segments: 50 samples (faster)

Each sample becomes a target point → motion segment

**Motion Segment Execution:**

For each consecutive pair of points:
1. Compute `Δx = x₂ - x₁`, `Δy = y₂ - y₁`
2. Calculate distance: `d = √(Δx² + Δy²)`
3. Determine target heading: `θ_target = atan2(Δy, Δx)`
4. Compute rotation needed: `Δθ = θ_target - θ_current`
5. Normalize Δθ to [-π, π]
6. Calculate wheel steps using kinematics
7. Execute synchronized motion
8. Update robot state

### 6. Coordinate Transformations

**Backend → Robot Conversion:**

1. **Unit conversion:**
   - Backend: 1 unit = 1 foot
   - Robot: meters
   - Conversion: multiply by 0.3048

2. **Relative coordinates:**
   - Each segment is in local frame of previous segment
   - Robot executes relative motions directly
   - No global position tracking needed (except for debugging)

3. **Frame transformation:**
   - Backend applies rotation matrices to express segments relative to previous
   - Robot interprets each segment starting from its current pose
   - Natural composition: segment₁ → segment₂ → segment₃

### 7. Pen Control

**Current Implementation:**
- Logs pen up/down actions
- Placeholder for future servo control

**Color Change Logic:**
```python
if color != previous_color:
    pen_up()
    log("Change pen to", color)
    # Future: wait for user or activate pen changer
    pen_down(color)
```

**Future Enhancement:**
```python
# Servo control example
SERVO_PIN = 18
PEN_UP_ANGLE = 90
PEN_DOWN_ANGLE = 45

def pen_down(color):
    servo.set_angle(PEN_DOWN_ANGLE)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for pen to lower

def pen_up():
    servo.set_angle(PEN_UP_ANGLE)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Wait for pen to raise
```

### 8. Speed Control

**Step Delays:**
- Drawing (pen down): 2ms per step → ~0.04 m/s
- Travel (pen up): 1ms per step → ~0.08 m/s

**Calculation:**

Speed = distance per second = (steps per second) / (steps per meter)

At 2ms per step:
- Steps per second: 1 / 0.002 = 500 steps/sec
- Speed: 500 / 12830 ≈ 0.039 m/s ✓

At 1ms per step:
- Steps per second: 1 / 0.001 = 1000 steps/sec
- Speed: 1000 / 12830 ≈ 0.078 m/s ✓

**Tuning:**
Adjust `STEP_DELAY_DRAW` and `STEP_DELAY_TRAVEL` for:
- Surface friction
- Pen resistance
- Desired accuracy vs speed tradeoff

### 9. Error Handling and Cleanup

**Interrupt Handling:**
```python
try:
    execute_drawing_program(...)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    logger.warning("Interrupted by user")
finally:
    pen_up()              # Ensure pen is raised
    deenergize_motors()   # Turn off coils
    GPIO.cleanup()        # Release GPIO pins
```

**Why this matters:**
- Safe shutdown on Ctrl+C
- Prevents motors from staying energized
- Releases GPIO resources for next run
- Ensures pen doesn't drag across paper

### 10. State Tracking

**RobotState Class:**
```python
class RobotState:
    x: float          # Current X position (meters)
    y: float          # Current Y position (meters)
    theta: float      # Current heading (radians)
    pen_down: bool    # Pen state
    current_color: str # Active color
```

**Purpose:**
- Track robot pose for computing next motion
- Monitor pen state for speed selection
- Log progress during execution
- Debugging and verification

**Update Logic:**
```python
def update_position(dx, dy, dtheta):
    self.x += dx
    self.y += dy
    self.theta += dtheta
    self.theta = normalize_angle(self.theta)  # Keep in [-π, π]
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Testing (Manual)

Test individual components:
```python
# Test kinematics
steps = compute_steps_for_motion(0.1, 0)  # 0.1m straight
assert steps[0] == steps[1]  # Equal steps

# Test rotation
steps = compute_steps_for_motion(0, math.pi/2)  # 90° turn
assert steps[0] == -steps[1]  # Opposite steps
```

### 2. Simulation Testing

Run complete program without hardware:
```bash
python robot_plotter.py <run_id> --simulate
```

Verifies:
- API communication
- Path parsing
- Kinematics calculations
- Control flow
- Error handling

### 3. Hardware Testing

Progressive validation:
1. Test single motor
2. Test both motors synchronized
3. Test straight line motion
4. Test rotation
5. Test simple curve
6. Test complete drawing

### 4. Calibration Testing

Measure actual vs expected:
- Draw 1m line → measure length
- Perform 360° rotation → check alignment
- Draw square → verify corners at 90°

Adjust constants if needed.

## Performance Characteristics

**Accuracy:**
- Resolution: ~0.078 mm per step
- Cumulative error: < 1% over 1 meter (with proper calibration)
- Angular accuracy: ~0.088° per step

**Speed:**
- Drawing: ~0.04 m/s (40 mm/s)
- Travel: ~0.08 m/s (80 mm/s)

2. Adaptive speed based on curvature
3. Force feedback for pen pressure
4. Multi-robot coordination
